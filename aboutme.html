            <p id="text2">Welcome to my page!

                I'm Elif Polat, a passionate and dedicated architecture student based in Istanbul, Turkey.
                
                My journey in the world of architecture began with a deep love for design and creativity. Born and raised in Istanbul, I have always been fascinated by the intricate blend of history and modernity that defines this vibrant city.
                
                After completing my primary education, I pursued my passion for the arts by studying ballet at the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts Conservatory. 
                I continued my academic journey at Burak Bora Anatolian High School.
                
                Currently, I am a fourth-year architecture student at Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University, where I am continuously inspired by the rich architectural heritage of Istanbul. Alongside my studies, I also work part-time at CM Architecture Office.
                
                Outside of architecture, I enjoy exploring new cultures, traveling, and capturing moments through photography.
                
                Thank you for visiting my page, and I hope you enjoy learning more about my journey and passion for architecture.</p>
